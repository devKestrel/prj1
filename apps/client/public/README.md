# Public Assets

- Place a racetrack background image named `track.jpg` in this folder.
- Recommended: wide image (e.g., 1920x1080) with the track spanning horizontally.
- The client draws `/track.jpg` as the canvas background; a procedural fallback (grass + dirt) is used if the file is missing.

File path to use:
- apps/client/public/track.jpg

You can replace with `track.png` by changing the code in `src/ui/App.tsx` if preferred.
